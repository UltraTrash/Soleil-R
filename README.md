The site is currently down until the project is complete. Apologies for the inconvenience.

***Soleil R*** is a lightweight web application that displays the data available from NASA's Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) API in a much more human-readable format. Whether you're curious as to just what's going on in our solar system or are gathering data on specific events, my hope is that this website can assist you in such endeavors. The source code is made available here for archival purposes.
