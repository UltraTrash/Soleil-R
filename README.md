Hi, welcome to Soleil! This is a web application that moniters space weather
events and essentially acts as a weather app for space phenomena. Utilizing
NASA's very own DONKI satellite, we are able to use data from said satellite
and produce a full-stack website with live updates on solar flares, 
interplanetory shocks, coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic storms
happening all over our solar system. Please look out for any updates
or improvements for this website as me and my team look forward to 
making this web page as awesome as possible for all of our space
enthusiast!
